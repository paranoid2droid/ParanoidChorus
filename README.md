## Building

So far I've only built under Windows. For use as standalone application or VST3, you can download my release version.
You need to build by yourself using JUCE if you want to compile an AU version, or to modify the codes.
Simply Download Juce (http://www.juce.com/) and import the project via Projucer.
Feel free to play!
